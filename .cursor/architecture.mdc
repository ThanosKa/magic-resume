# Project Architecture

## Tech Stack
- Package manager: pnpm
- Framework: Next.js 16 (App Router) with React 19
- Styling: Tailwind CSS 4, Radix UI primitives, Framer Motion
- State: Zustand; validation via Zod + React Hook Form
- Build: Turbopack for dev, Next build for prod

## Package/Repo Structure
- `.cursor/` – assistant rules and guidelines
- `.claude/agents/` – agent definitions (planning, etc.)
- `app/` – routes and layout (App Router)
- `components/landing/` – marketing/landing UI
- `components/editor/` – CV editor UI; previews and forms
- `components/ui/` – shared UI primitives (stateless/styled)
- `store/` – Zustand store for CV state
- `types/` – shared TypeScript types
- `lib/` – utilities/helpers
- `styles/` – Tailwind and global styles

## Key Principles
- Keep UI primitives reusable and stateless; control styling via props/classes.
- Let Zustand own the source-of-truth CV data; components consume via selectors to minimize rerenders.
- Prefer composition: small sections (forms, previews, lists) should be swappable without changing global state.
- Isolate async/side effects (AI helpers, network) in `lib/`; keep components declarative.
- Avoid hydration drift by keeping random IDs and browser-only logic out of server-rendered branches.
