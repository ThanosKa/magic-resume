# Architecture

- Landing page components live in `components/landing`; editor pieces live under `components/editor` with state in `store/`.
- Keep UI primitives in `components/ui` reusable and stateless; styling should be controlled via props/classes.
- Zustand store should own source-of-truth CV data; components consume via selectors to minimize rerenders.
- Shared types belong in `types/`; avoid duplicating shape definitions between editor and preview.
- Prefer composition over configuration: small sections (forms, previews, lists) should be swappable without touching global state.
- Keep async/side-effect code (API calls, AI helpers) isolated in `lib/` so components stay declarative.
