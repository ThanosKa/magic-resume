# React Guidelines

- Default to Server Components; mark interactive pieces with `"use client"` and keep them lean.
- Prevent hydration drift: avoid random IDs/`Date.now()` during render, and gate browser-only code with a mounted check.
- Co-locate animations and event handlers inside client components; keep data/logic in hooks or stores.
- Use `Link` for navigation, `Button` with `asChild` when wrapping anchor elements, and keep aria labels on icon-only controls.
- Keep component props small and serializable; prefer passing IDs and selectors to Zustand rather than whole objects.
- Memoize expensive calculations and prefer CSS/transforms over layout-thrashing animations.
