# Cursor Rules

- Prefer pnpm for dependency tasks.
- Avoid destructive git commands; never reset user changes.
- Keep output ASCII unless existing file requires otherwise.
- Use `rg` for search and `pnpm lint` before committing changes.
- Favor small, focused commits with clear messages.
- Follow guidelines in accompanying .mdc files for style and architecture.
