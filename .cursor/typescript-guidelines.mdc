# TypeScript Guidelines

## Type Definitions
- Interface for component props (suffix `Props`); `type` for data/util/unions.
- Prefer string literal unions over enums (except generated).
- Use `as const` for literal inference and readonly maps.

## Strict Typing
- Avoid `any`; use `unknown` + guards when needed.
- Rely on strict compiler options; let inference work and annotate exports.
- Narrow external data with Zod validators before use.

## Type Patterns
- Use discriminated unions and dedicated type guards.
- Use descriptive generics (`TData`, `TError`).
- Reach for utility types (`Partial`, `Pick`, `Omit`) before custom shapes.
- Use `import type` for type-only imports; keep value and type imports separate when possible.

## Path Alias
- Use configured aliases (`@/`) instead of deep relative paths.

## Best Practices
- Export shared types from `types/`; keep types near usage otherwise.
- Favor immutable updates (Immer/Zustand patterns); avoid mutating inputs.
- Use optional chaining/nullish coalescing with strict null checks.
